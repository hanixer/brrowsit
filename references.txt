----------------------------------

Block-level elements - e.g. <p>, <div> 

Block-level boxes are boxes that participate in a block formatting context

Principal block-level box - these generated e.g. from <p>, <div>

Block container box either contains only block-level boxes or establishes 
an inline formatting context and thus contains only inline-level boxes

Inline-level elements - like <em>
Element with a 'display' value of 'inline' generates an inline box

Any text that is directly contained inside a block container element 
(not inside an inline element) must be treated as an anonymous inline element

In a block formatting context, boxes are laid out one after the other, 
vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. 

-----------------

In an inline formatting context, boxes are laid out 
horizontally, one after the other, beginning at the top of a containing block.

Line box - rectangular area that contains the boxes that form a line.
Width - from containing, height - from contained.
When an inline box exceeds the width of a line box, it is split into several 
boxes and these boxes are distributed across several line boxes
If an inline box cannot be split then the inline box overflows the line box. --- I think, it is better to not implementing splitting now.

A paragraph is a vertical stack of line boxes.

--------------------------

 Here is an example of inline box construction. The following paragraph (created by the HTML block-level element P) contains anonymous text interspersed with the elements EM and STRONG:


<P>Several <EM>emphasized words</EM> appear
<STRONG>in this</STRONG> sentence, dear.</P>

The P element generates a block box that contains five inline boxes, three of which are anonymous:

    Anonymous: "Several"
    EM: "emphasized words"
    Anonymous: "appear"
    STRONG: "in this"
    Anonymous: "sentence, dear."

To format the paragraph, the user agent flows the five boxes into line boxes. In this example, the box generated for the P element establishes the containing block for the line boxes. If the containing block is sufficiently wide, all the inline boxes will fit into a single line box:

 Several emphasized words appear in this sentence, dear.

If not, the inline boxes will be split up and distributed across several line boxes. The previous paragraph might be split as follows:

Several emphasized words appear
in this sentence, dear.

or like this:

Several emphasized  
words appear in this 
sentence, dear.
